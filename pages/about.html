                <p>Colorado Coed Soccer League (CCSL) was founded in 1987 and is one of Colorado's premier adult recreational soccer leagues.</p>
                <p>CCSL is comprised of 16 teams organized into 2 divisions, and we are kept in line by some of Colorado's best Certified Officials.</p>
                <p>We play during the Spring and Fall at Englewood High School.</p>
                <p>Our schedule consists of 7 weeks of regular season game play, and a 3 week knock-out style playoff bracket, so 10 weeks in all if a team makes it all the way to the Championship.</p>
                <p>Players are required to be 21 years of age and up, and represent a wide range of experience levels.</p>
                <p>CCSL also sponsors a league celebration at the end of every season.</p>
