<h1 align="center">ABOUT US</h1>
<p>Colorado Coed Soccer League (CCSL) was founded in 1987 and is one of Colorado's premier adult recreational soccer leagues.</p> 
<p>CCSL is comprised of 16 teams organized into 2 divisions, and we are kept in line by some of Colorado's best Certified Officials.</p>
<p>We play during the Spring and Fall at Englewood High School.</p> 
<p>Our schedule consists of 7 weeks of regular season game play, and a 3 week knock-out style playoff bracket, so 10 weeks in all if a team makes it all the way to the Championship.</p>
<p>Players are 21 years of age and up, and represent a wide range of experience levels.</p>
<p>CCSL also sponsors a League celebration at the end of every season.</p>
